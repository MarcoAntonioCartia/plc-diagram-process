# ======================================================================
#  IMPORTANT GPU ENVIRONMENT NOTES (WINDOWS)
# ======================================================================
#
# Python Version: Python 3.11.x is required for this project.
#
# GPU Library Conflict: This project uses both PyTorch (for YOLO) and
# PaddlePaddle (for OCR). Both libraries bundle their own CUDA runtimes.
# To prevent "DLL Hell" on Windows, it is CRITICAL that both frameworks
# are installed using wheels compiled against the same CUDA toolkit version.
#
# The recommended stable configuration is to standardize on CUDA 12.1.
#
# To build the environment correctly, do NOT just run "pip install -r requirements.txt".
# Instead, install the GPU frameworks MANUALLY in this specific order:
#
# 1. (Optional) Uninstall any conflicting versions first:
#    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio paddlepaddle-gpu -y
#
# 2. Install PyTorch for CUDA 12.1 (This provides the base runtime):
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# 3. Install PaddlePaddle for CUDA 12.x (This will use the runtime installed by PyTorch):
#    pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==3.0.0
#
# 4. Install all remaining requirements from this file:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
