# GPU Optimization Analysis Experiments

This folder contains experimental code and analysis from GPU pipeline optimization attempts.

## Summary

**Result**: The original GPU pipeline significantly outperforms the attempted optimization.

- **Original GPU Pipeline**: ~72 img/s (excellent performance)
- **"Optimized" Version**: ~15-25 img/s (65-79% slower)

## Files

### Experimental Code
- `detect_pipeline_gpu_optimized_fixed.py` - Attempted optimization using YOLO native batch processing
- `benchmark_gpu_comparison.py` - Comprehensive benchmark comparing original vs optimized implementations

### Benchmark Results
- `gpu_benchmark_results_*.json` - Raw benchmark data showing performance regression

## Key Findings

1. **Original implementation is already highly optimized** for the specific hardware and use case
2. **Custom Dataset + DataLoader approach** outperforms YOLO's native batch processing
3. **File I/O overhead** in the "optimized" version significantly impacts performance
4. **Framework-specific optimizations** sometimes beat framework defaults

## Lessons Learned

- Don't fix what isn't broken - benchmark before optimizing
- Custom implementations can outperform framework defaults for specific use cases
- Environment and hardware-specific optimizations matter significantly

## Recommendation

**Continue using the original GPU pipeline** (`src/detection/detect_pipeline_gpu_optimized.py`) with the `--parallel` flag for best performance.

Focus future optimization efforts on:
- Model-level optimizations (ONNX, TensorRT)
- System-level tuning
- Other pipeline stages (preprocessing, reconstruction)
