### Key Insights

1. **Overlapping Issue Source**: PDF preprocessing creates overlapping snippets (default: 500px overlap) for complete detection coverage, but this causes Figures near snippet boundaries to be detected multiple times.

2. **Dual Paths**:
   - **Path 1**: PyMuPDF for direct PDF text extraction (fast, high confidence)
   - **Path 2**: PaddleOCR for image-based text extraction (handles scanned content)

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Comprehensive PLC-specific regex patterns for I/O addresses, timers, counters, etc.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Detection Preprocessor (`src/ocr/detection_preprocessor.py`)

**Purpose**: Remove overlapping and redundant detection boxes before text extraction.

**Key Features**:
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: Removes overlapping detections of the same class
- **IoU-based filtering**: Configurable overlap threshold (default: 0.5)
- **Confidence filtering**: Removes low-confidence detections
- **Class-specific NMS**: Handles different symbol types independently

**Usage**:
```python
from src.ocr.detection_preprocessor import DetectionPreprocessor

preprocessor = DetectionPreprocessor(iou_threshold=0.5, confidence_threshold=0.25)
processed_data = preprocessor.preprocess_detection_file(detection_file, output_file)
```

**CLI Usage**:
```bash
python src/ocr/detection_preprocessor.py --input /path/to/detections.json --iou-threshold 0.5
```

### 2. Enhanced Text Extraction Runner (`src/ocr/run_enhanced_text_extraction.py`)

**Purpose**: Integrates detection preprocessing with existing text extraction pipeline.

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic preprocessing**: Removes overlapping detections before text extraction
- **Flexible configuration**: Adjustable IoU and confidence thresholds
- **Batch processing**: Handles entire folders of detection files
- **Backward compatibility**: Can skip preprocessing if desired

**Usage**:
```bash
# Process entire folder with preprocessing
python src/ocr/run_enhanced_text_extraction.py \
    --detection-folder /path/to/detections \
    --pdf-folder /path/to/pdfs \
    --output-folder /path/to/output \
    --iou-threshold 0.5 \
    --confidence 0.7

# Process single file
python src/ocr/run_enhanced_text_extraction.py \
    --single-file /path/to/detection.json \
    --pdf-folder /path/to/pdfs \
    --output-folder /path/to/output
```

## How the Dual Verification Paths Work

### Path 1: PDF-First Approach (Existing in your pipeline)
1. **Direct PDF text extraction** using PyMuPDF (fast, accurate for digital text)
2. **Symbol association** with nearby detected elements
3. **PLC pattern matching** for relevance scoring

**Advantages**:
- Very fast execution
- High accuracy for digital PDFs
- Perfect character recognition for typed text

**Limitations**:
- Fails on scanned/image-based PDFs
- May miss text embedded in graphics

### Path 2: OCR-First Approach (Existing in your pipeline)
1. **PDF to image conversion** with high resolution (2x zoom)
2. **Region-based OCR** using PaddleOCR on detected symbol areas
3. **Confidence-based filtering** and validation

**Advantages**:
- Works on any PDF type (digital or scanned)
- Can extract text from graphics and images
- Handles rotated or stylized text

**Limitations**:
- Slower execution
- Potential OCR errors
- Dependent on image quality

### Smart Combination (Your Current Implementation)
Your pipeline already intelligently combines both methods:

```python
# From text_extraction_pipeline.py
def _combine_and_associate_texts(self, pdf_texts, ocr_texts, detection_data):
    """Combine PDF and OCR texts, removing duplicates and associating with symbols"""
    combined_texts = []
    
    # Start with PDF texts (higher priority)
    for pdf_text in pdf_texts:
        combined_texts.append(pdf_text)
    
    # Add OCR texts that don't overlap significantly with PDF texts
    for ocr_text in ocr_texts:
        is_duplicate = False
        for pdf_text in pdf_texts:
            if (self._texts_overlap(pdf_text, ocr_text) and
                self._texts_similar(pdf_text.text, ocr_text.text)):
                is_duplicate = True
                break
        
        if not is_duplicate:
            combined_texts.append(ocr_text)
```

## Expected Improvements

### 1. Reduced Redundancy
- **Before**: Multiple detections of same tag-ID from overlapping snippets
- **After**: Single, highest-confidence detection per tag-ID
- **Expected reduction**: 20-40% fewer duplicate detections

### 2. Improved Accuracy
- **Better text-symbol association**: Cleaner detection results improve spatial relationships
- **Reduced noise**: Fewer false positives from low-confidence detections
- **Pattern matching**: More accurate PLC-specific text identification

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Faster processing**: Fewer regions to process for text extraction
- **Better resource utilization**: Focus OCR processing on areas without PDF text
- **Scalable**: Preprocessing scales linearly with detection count

## Integration Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Implementation
Start with the enhanced runner to test preprocessing effects:

```bash
# Test on a small batch first
python src/ocr/run_enhanced_text_extraction.py \
    --detection-folder /path/to/test/detections \
    --pdf-folder /path/to/test/pdfs \
    --output-folder /path/to/test/output \
    --iou-threshold 0.5
```

### 2. Parameter Tuning
Adjust thresholds based on your specific data:

- **IoU Threshold**: 
  - Lower (0.3-0.4): More aggressive overlap removal
  - Higher (0.6-0.7): More conservative, keeps more detections
  
- **Confidence Threshold**:
  - Detection preprocessing: Keep lower (0.25) to preserve weak signals
  - Text extraction: Keep higher (0.7) for quality results

### 3. Validation Workflow
1. **Run preprocessing on sample data**
2. **Compare detection counts** (original vs processed)
3. **Verify text extraction quality** (accuracy vs coverage)
4. **Tune parameters** based on results
5. **Deploy to full pipeline**

### 4. Future Enhancements
Consider implementing:
- **Spatial clustering**: Group nearby detections before NMS
- **Class-aware thresholds**: Different IoU thresholds per symbol type
- **Confidence calibration**: Better confidence score normalization
- **Active learning**: Use extraction results to improve detection

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```python
# Test detection preprocessing
def test_detection_preprocessing():
    preprocessor = DetectionPreprocessor(iou_threshold=0.5)
    # Load test detection file with known overlaps
    result = preprocessor.preprocess_detection_file(test_file)
    assert result['summary']['reduction_percentage'] > 0
```

### Integration Testing
```python
# Test full pipeline
def test_enhanced_extraction():
    # Run both original and enhanced pipelines
    original_results = run_original_pipeline(test_files)
    enhanced_results = run_enhanced_pipeline(test_files)
    
    # Compare results
    assert enhanced_results['text_count'] >= original_results['text_count'] * 0.95
    assert enhanced_results['processing_time'] <= original_results['processing_time']
```

### Performance Benchmarking
Track key metrics:
- **Detection reduction percentage**
- **Text extraction accuracy**
- **Processing time per file**
- **Memory usage**

## Configuration Examples

### Conservative (Minimal Changes)
```python
DetectionPreprocessor(iou_threshold=0.7, confidence_threshold=0.1)
```

### Balanced (Recommended)
```python
DetectionPreprocessor(iou_threshold=0.5, confidence_threshold=0.25)
```

### Aggressive (Maximum Cleanup)
```python
DetectionPreprocessor(iou_threshold=0.3, confidence_threshold=0.4)
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Preprocessing Statistics
The system provides detailed statistics:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_original_detections": 1500,
    "total_processed_detections": 1200,
    "reduction_percentage": 20.0
  }
}
```

### Debugging Overlapping Detections
Enable verbose output to see which detections are suppressed:
```
Suppressed overlapping detection: tag_id (conf: 0.456, IoU: 0.678)
```

This comprehensive improvement should significantly enhance your text extraction pipeline's reliability and efficiency while addressing the specific tag-ID overlap issue you mentioned.
